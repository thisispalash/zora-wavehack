## :chains: Wave 1 ( -> 04/05) 
> Architecture overview and build plan

The plan this wave was to understand Zora Coins and formulate a plan to integrate it with 
[semicolon-fingers](https://github.com/sliver-labs/semicolon-fingers). Initial thinking is that 
Coins can be integrated in two parts of the network, to incentivize usage, and fund the initial
stages of the network — [reader-trails](./waves/wave01.md#reader-trails) and 
[writer-ngrams](./waves/wave01.md#writer-ngrams). Additionally, it was also to divide the project
into two versions, an initial proof of concept, where the contracts live on an L2 (Base), and a 
subsequent L3, where the rollup is purpose driven to perform onchain sentiment analysis.

Please see the [specific markdown](./waves/wave01.md) for more details.

## :desktop_computer: Wave 2 ( -> 04/19)
> Initial build

The plan for this wave is to ship the first version of the project. This includes the deployment
of contracts, wrapping up frontend, managing auth, and integrate Coins SDK for the reader side. 

The MVP was ~60% completed, rest will be covered in the next wave.

Please see the [specific markdown](./waves/wave02.md) for more details.

## :footprints: Wave 3 ( -> 05/04)
> Zora Integration

This wave will be about completing the MVP, deploying contracts, and finally integrating Zora 
Coins. Stretch goal is to create some form of generative art for beautiful display on zora.co 
(and other platforms).

Please see the [specific markdown](./waves/wave03.md) for more details.

## :x: Wave 4 ( -> 05/18)
> skipped

This wave was skipped due to other engagements.

## :computer: Wave 5 ( -> 06/01)
> Refactor to monorepo

The primary aim this wave was to actually ship the project. However, shipping will require another 
wave. The main focus this wave was to shift to a monorepo since there were a lot of repeated 
components.

Please see the [specific markdown](./waves/wave05.md) for more details.

## :rowboat: Wave 6 ( -> 06/15)
> Ship! Ship! Ship!

It is time to finally ship the damn project!

Please see the [specific markdown](./waves/wave06.md) for feature list.
