## :chains: Wave 1 ( -> 04/05) 
> Architecture overview and build plan

The plan this wave was to understand Zora Coins and formulate a plan to integrate it with 
[semicolon-fingers](https://github.com/sliver-labs/semicolon-fingers). Initial thinking is that 
Coins can be integrated in two parts of the network, to incentivize usage, and fund the initial
stages of the network — [reader-trails](./waves/wave01.md#reader-trails) and 
[writer-ngrams](./waves/wave01.md#writer-ngrams). Additionally, it was also to divide the project
into two versions, an initial proof of concept, where the contracts live on an L2 (Base), and a 
subsequent L3, where the rollup is purpose driven to perform onchain sentiment analysis.

Please see the [specific markdown](./waves/wave01.md) for more details.

## :desktop_computer: Wave 2 ( -> 04/19)
> Initial build

The plan for this wave is to ship the first version of the project. This includes the deployment
of contracts, wrapping up frontend, managing auth, and integrate Coins SDK for the reader side. 

The MVP was ~60% completed, rest will be covered in the next wave.

Please see the [specific markdown](./waves/wave02.md) for more details.

## :footprints: Wave 3 ( -> 05/03)
> Zora Integration

This wave will be about completing the MVP, deploying contracts, and finally integrating Zora 
Coins. Stretch goal is to create some form of generative art for beautiful display on zora.co 
(and other platforms).

Please see the [specific markdown](./waves/wave03.md) for more details.

## :bar_chart: Wave 4 ( -> 05/17)
> Leaderboards

In this wave, the focus will be on integrating a leaderboard and trading within the platform. An
additional goal this wave may also be to add profile views within the platform.

## :robot: Wave 5 ( -> 05/31)
> Ngram explorations

The ultimate goal of this project is to enable onchain sentiment analysis. As such, this wave will
focus on how to incorporate a SVM within the network, and any related architecture for a rollup.

An additional goal this wave will be to complete the profile / account view within the platform
(and enable withdrawals).

## :hammer_and_wrench: Wave 6+ 
> Implementing v2

June onwards the focus will be entirely on v2 of the project, assuming v1 is successfully shipped.
As such, plans for wave 6 onwards depends heavily on wave 5 (and prior), and will be updated in
time.
