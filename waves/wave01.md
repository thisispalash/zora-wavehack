# :chains: Wave 01
> Initial plan and v1 architecture

The goal of this wave was to understand how to best incorporate Zora's Coins Protocol into
Semicolon Fingers. This has resulted in a clear versioning of the project into two parts, each 
version providing a new way to interact with the Coins Protocol.

Additionally, integrating Coins may be the key to making Semicolon Fingers self sustainable, as 
well as allowing the project to bootstrap itself (as a result of 
[Zora rewards](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/2509953))! See [tokenomics](#tokenomics) below 
for more details.

## Versioning

The versions can be thought of in two ways, the core feature enabling Semicolon Fingers (ie, 
[mvp](#v1-mvp) or [sentiment analysis](#v2-svm)), or which side of the network gets access to 
Coins (ie, [readers](#reader-trails) and then [writers](#writer-ngrams)).

### MVP (v1)

### SVM (v2)

## Zora Coins integration

Zora Coins will be available to create for both, readers and writers. Each type of Coin will serve
a different purpose, and power Semicolon Fingers accordingly.

### Reader Trails

### Writer Ngrams

## Architecture Overview

Semicolon Fingers [v1](#mvp-v1) will reside entirely on Base, sepolia and mainnet. For the rollup
architecture, it is best to see [wave 05](./wave05.md).

### Contracts

### Web2

## User Flow

The user interacts with the network in two primary ways, the [writer side](https://emptyyourmug.com/) 
or the [reader side](https://pullmythread.com/). Their account, and related actions, live on the 
[primary domain](https://semicolonfingers.com), however, this part will be built out in 
[wave 04](./wave04.md).
