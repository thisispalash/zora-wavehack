# :desktop_computer: Wave 02
> Initial Build

The goal this wave is to ship an initial MVP, complete with frontend, contracts, and a minimal server (for auth).

## The Plan

- [x] Auth Server ~ https://github.com/thisispalash/semicolon-auth (is private, message for access)
- [x] Contracts ~ https://github.com/sliver-labs/semicolon-forge
- [ ] Writer portal ~ https://github.com/thisispalash/emptyyourmug
- [ ] Reader portal ~ https://github.com/thisispalash/pullmythread

## Updates

- Contract deployments are pending, need to understand `CREATE2` before deploying
- Auth layer has no tests
- Integrating auth with reader and writer portions still pending
- Reader and writer portals moved to next wave
